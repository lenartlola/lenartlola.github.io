## Hello World!

I'm Lenart, or that's at least my pseudo, I'm currently student at [42 Lausanne](https://www.42lausanne.ch/).
I'm a curious programmer, I like to learn different things and share my experience
therefore I created this blog to share my genuine thoughts.

Be aware, what I'm writing here is all my thought and ideas, they may not be correct, 
feel free to reach me and correct me if you don't mind, I would appreciate it.

I like doing CTF like challenges (I'm not into `cyber security` though) and there would be a lot of different topics.
